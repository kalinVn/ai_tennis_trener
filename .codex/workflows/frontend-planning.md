# New Frontend Planning — Debug Execution

This is the planning prefix of `claude/agents/new-frontend-orchestrator.md` (Steps 1–3), with the original planner and validator contracts adapted for Codex. Its terminal artifact/translation phase replaces every implementation step. The coordinator runs the planner role itself and uses a separate agent for validation; a Claude-specific agent registry is not required.

## 1. Establish the Run

- Receive the explicit `specification_path` from [debug_frontend_plan](../commands/debug_frontend_plan.md). Follow its write boundary for this entire run, including delegated work.
- Record the starting repository status in memory so pre-existing edits are not attributed to this run. Keep run evidence in memory until the two final artifacts are written; no additional repository trace files.
- Load [planning rules](../rules/frontend-planning.md), the supplied specification, and the required references selected by that specification. Missing input/source, unresolved conflicts, or unavailable required evidence stop the planning/validation phase; continue to artifact publication with an honest blocked report.

## 2. Generate the English Plan

- Execute [Plan New Frontend Design](../skills/plan-new-frontend-design.md) as the planner role, applying [architecture context](../references/frontend-architecture.md). Do not replace it with an example or shortened debug-only planner.
- Preserve its complete Output Contract: Frontend Type (`new`), Project Structure, Open Questions and Blockers, and Build Order. The Project Structure section must reference `docs/frontend/frontend-project-structure.md` and add only plan-specific ownership or concrete placement needed for implementation; it must not reproduce the canonical tree or general placement rules. Include the source-required design foundation, layouts, pages/routes/access, shared/feature components, ownership, dependencies, responsive/accessibility states, and acceptance/test requirements needed for the validator and future builders. Use subsections/tables as appropriate; do not invent requirements solely to populate a template.
- Inspect source prototypes and relevant existing patterns. Identify specific source-backed decisions, reusable resources verified on disk, planned new paths, and unresolved dependencies. Keep inspection evidence distinct from unperformed visual/runtime verification.
- Return a complete English plan. No project directories or implementation files are created. Implementation skill selection remains outside this planning command, as in the source planner.

## 3. Independently Validate and Correct

- Spawn a separate read-only validation agent using [Frontend Plan Validator](../skills/frontend-plan-validator.md). Supply the original `specification_path`, the complete latest English plan, active project/task constraints, the planning rules, and access to raw referenced sources. Instruct it to read those sources independently and return its structured result without edits. Do not coach it toward a desired verdict.
- A valid result requires `status: valid`, empty `errors`, and an exact unchanged `validated_plan`. Retain warnings. An invalid result requires actionable errors and `validated_plan: null`.
- On invalid results, give the planner the original specification, rejected plan, and errors. Generate a complete corrected plan and validate it independently again. Permit at most two corrections after the initial validation: three validator invocations total. Do not reset this counter or alter a valid plan after the gate without revalidation.
- Stop the correction loop immediately for missing required material, a necessary user decision, a failed/absent/malformed result, or unavailable independent-agent capability. Do not silently self-validate or mark an unvalidated plan valid. Save the latest draft with blocked status and the exact limitation. If all three results are invalid, report remaining errors and attempts used.
- Even a valid result does not permit project-structure creation or any implementation step. Continue only to saving and translation.

## 4. Save the English Artifact

Write `docs/debug_plan_outputs/new_frontend_plan_N.md` in English. Use a Markdown report containing:

1. **Execution Record:** command, explicit specification path (or missing input), outcome (`valid`, `invalid`, or `blocked`), validator invocations, correction attempts, source paths/locations actually inspected, relevant source precedence/overrides, and the concrete evidence behind architectural decisions. Report findings/decisions, not hidden reasoning or invented execution logs.
2. **Frontend Implementation Plan:** the complete final validated plan unchanged, or the latest unvalidated/rejected draft clearly labeled. If no draft could be produced, say why and list what source material is required; do not invent an example plan.
3. **Validation Findings:** all unresolved errors, non-blocking warnings, and unavailable checks with source locations and required resolution. Distinguish plan validity from future implementation tests, which have not run.
4. **Stop Status:** planning only; no implementation started.

The execution envelope is not part of `validated_plan`; do not represent report metadata added after validation as a modification of the approved plan. Do not repeat the complete plan inside the validator-result metadata.

## 5. Translate the Saved English Artifact

- Read the exact saved English file and translate it into Bulgarian at `docs/debug_plan_outputs/new_frontend_plan_BG.md`. The English artifact is the sole content source for translation; do not rerun planning or independently derive decisions from prototypes/specifications.
- Preserve heading levels/order, sections, list numbering/nesting, table dimensions/row order, all steps, decisions, warnings, blockers, qualifications, and meaning. Translate narrative headings/text while retaining the same structure.
- Preserve file paths, URLs/link destinations, identifiers, class/component names, API names, technical terminology, inline code, fenced code, configuration keys, literal statuses, numeric values/units, and file-tree/code examples exactly. Use natural Bulgarian for surrounding prose; do not rename technical entities or add explanations absent from English.
- Do not summarize, omit, reorder, add, or silently correct the plan in translation. If an English-plan correction is necessary, return through validation within the same bounded budget and regenerate the translation from the newly saved English artifact. Corrections limited to translation do not change the English plan.

## 6. Check the Pair and STOP

- Check both saved files are present, nonempty, and belong to this run, rather than leaving a previous Bulgarian report paired with a new English one.
- Compare heading/list/table structure, numbered steps, code blocks, inline technical tokens, links, paths, numeric values, architecture decisions, and all findings. Perform a semantic translation review; structural checks alone cannot prove equivalence.
- Recheck repository changes against the starting status. Only the two output files may change during this execution; report any unexpected edits without overwriting or reverting user work.
- Report paths, actual planning/validation outcome, attempts, remaining findings, and translation checks. If saving/translation fails, explicitly report the incomplete pair and never claim success.
- **STOP.** Never proceed to original orchestrator Step 4 (Establish Project Structure) or any subsequent build/integration/testing/implementation phase. A Build Order in the plan is future work, not an instruction to execute now.
