# New Frontend Workflow

Use only when the user explicitly requests construction of a new frontend and supplies `specification_path`. This workflow is the Codex adaptation of `claude/agents/new-frontend-orchestrator.md`.

## Gate

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/rules/frontend-planning.md`, and the supplied specification.
2. Run the planner contract in `.codex/skills/plan-new-frontend-design.md`.
3. Use a separate read-only agent with `.codex/skills/frontend-plan-validator.md`.
4. Require `status: valid`, no errors, and an exact unchanged `validated_plan`.
5. Permit at most two planner corrections after the initial validation. Stop earlier for missing evidence, a required user decision, malformed validation, or unavailable independent validation.
6. Never implement from an invalid or unvalidated plan.

## Delivery

After validation, use the plan's Build Order and select only required discoverable skills under `.codex/skill-adapters/`. Establish structure from `docs/frontend/frontend-project-structure.md`; do not add a frontend `modules/` layer or empty placeholders.

Build in dependency order:

1. design foundation and application structure
2. shared components
3. feature components and browser/integration boundaries
4. layouts and pages
5. routing and guards
6. responsive/accessibility behavior
7. integration, tests, code-quality review, and final verification

Reuse before extension, extension before new implementation. Keep one authoritative owner for persisted state and each resource lifecycle. Preserve the frontend/backend boundaries in `AGENTS.md` and the specification.

## Verification and Report

Run applicable build, type/static checks, lint, unit/component tests, and browser tests. Verify responsive/accessibility and security-sensitive contracts. Do not claim unperformed or mocked work as live functionality.

Report the specification, validation attempts/warnings, skills used, files and routes changed, integrations, checks with actual outcomes, and unresolved dependencies.
