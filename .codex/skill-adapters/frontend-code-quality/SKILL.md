# Frontend Code Quality

Read `../../../claude/skills/frontend-code-quality.md`, but override its JavaScript-only rule: this project requires TypeScript.

Inspect the actual diff and consumers. Check correctness, narrow ownership, explicit control flow, duplication, dead state, unnecessary abstraction/dependencies/global state, accessibility, frontend/backend boundaries, and applicable realtime cleanup/performance.

Do not rewrite unrelated code. Run relevant checks and report findings by severity with file evidence; fix only when implementation is authorized.
