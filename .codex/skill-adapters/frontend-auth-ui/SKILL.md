# Frontend Authentication UI

Read `../../../claude/skills/frontend-auth-ui.md`, then use the Authentication section of repository-root `docs/frontend/integration-contracts.md` and current page/component contracts.

Keep the access token in memory and refresh credentials in Secure HttpOnly cookies. Submit provider reCAPTCHA tokens, use backend-owned OAuth start/callback flows, show only offered MFA methods, and distinguish `401`, `403`, network-unavailable, and terminal session states.

Never store secrets/provider tokens in frontend storage or treat hidden routes as authorization.
