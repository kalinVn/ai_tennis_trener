# Frontend Design-System Adapter

The maintained shared design rules remain at `claude/rules/frontend/frontend-design-system.md`. Read that file in place when frontend planning, building, updating, reviewing, or validating needs visual, interaction, responsive, accessibility, token, component, or CSS guidance.

Apply precedence in this order:

1. active user request
2. supplied update/task specification
3. `docs/frontend/frontend.md` and its authoritative supporting documents
4. referenced prototypes
5. existing project tokens/components
6. the shared Claude design-system defaults

Do not duplicate the 1,000+ line source into `.codex`; this adapter keeps Codex synchronized with its latest compatible version while avoiding two maintained copies.
